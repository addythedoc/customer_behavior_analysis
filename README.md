# **Customer Shopping Behavior – Data Analytics Project**

## **📌 Overview**

This project showcases a complete **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, beginning with loading and cleaning raw data in Python, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), storing and querying the cleaned data in a MySQL database, building key business insights using SQL, and finally developing an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.
A written report and a presentation (built using **Gamma**) summarize the findings.

This project demonstrates skills in **Python, SQL, Analytics, Visualization, and Reporting**.
